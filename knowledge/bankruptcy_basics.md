# Cryptocurrency Exchange Bankruptcy Proceedings

## Asset Segregation Requirements

In cryptocurrency exchange bankruptcies, proper asset segregation is critical for creditor recovery. Customer funds should be maintained separately from operational assets.

### Key Principles

1. **Customer Asset Segregation**: Customer deposits must be held in segregated accounts
2. **Operational Separation**: Exchange operational funds separate from customer assets  
3. **Chain of Custody**: Maintain complete audit trail of asset movements
4. **Reconciliation**: Regular reconciliation between on-chain and off-chain records

## Tracing Methodology

Asset tracing in crypto bankruptcies involves:

- **On-chain Analysis**: Following blockchain transactions using transaction hashes
- **Off-chain Reconciliation**: Matching internal ledger records with blockchain data
- **Entity Resolution**: Identifying beneficial ownership of wallet addresses
- **Flow Analysis**: Understanding the complete path of asset movements

### Documentation Standards

All findings must include:
- Source citations to specific transaction IDs or blockchain hashes
- Confidence levels for entity identifications
- Clear methodology descriptions
- Limitations and uncertainties

## Claims Process

Customer claims must be verified against:
- Internal ledger records (spot and margin)
- Blockchain transaction history  
- KYC/AML documentation
- Withdrawal/deposit records

Priority of claims follows standard bankruptcy law with customer assets receiving priority treatment where properly segregated.
